title: Role README.md files
---
Each role has a README.md file which describes:

* the purpose of the role
* requirements and dependencies
* role parameters
* data returned by the role, if any
* examples

These README.md files are available in many places:

* in RPM installs at /usr/share/doc/linux-system-roles
* Ansible Galaxy - click on the Documentation tab of a role - for example, the [Sudo role](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/standalone/roles/linux-system-roles/sudo/documentation/)
* Github - this is the home page for the role - for example, the [Sudo role](https://github.com/linux-system-roles/sudo) - scroll down past the file list

Note that the documentation on Galaxy or Github can be for a newer version.
It's best to use the documentation that came with your installation.
Check that your version of the role matches the version of the README.md.
