The **Linux System Roles** are a collection of roles and modules executed by
Ansible to assist Linux admins in the configuration of common GNU/Linux
subsystems. Conceptually, the intent is to serve as a consistent "API" to a
give Linux distribution that is consistent across multiple major and minor
releases. This collection is available in Ansible Galaxy at
[linux-system-roles](https://galaxy.ansible.com/linux-system-roles/).

## Consistent and abstract

A major objective is that the role will provide a consistent user interface to
provide settings to a given subsystem that is abstract from any particular
implementation.  For example, assigning an IP Address to a network interface
should be a generic concept separate from any particular implementations such
as init networking scripts, NetworkManager, or systemd-networkd.

## Utilize the subsystems' native libraries
Whenever possible, the modules for this effort will take advantage of the
native libraries and interfaces provided by the distribution, rather than
calling upon CLI commands.  Example libraries include dbus, libnm, and similar
interfaces which provide robust and strictly defined inputs.

## Currently supported distributions

- Fedora
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL 6+)
- RHEL 6+ derivatives such as CentOS 6+

## Currently supported subsystems

- [email (postfix)](https://galaxy.ansible.com/linux-system-roles/postfix/)
- [kdump (kernel crash dump)](https://galaxy.ansible.com/linux-system-roles/kdump/)
- [network](https://galaxy.ansible.com/linux-system-roles/network/)
- [selinux](https://galaxy.ansible.com/linux-system-roles/selinux/)
- [timesync](https://galaxy.ansible.com/linux-system-roles/timesync/)

## Subsystems on the roadmap

- Red Hat Subscription Management
- [firewall](https://galaxy.ansible.com/linux-system-roles/firewall/)
- system logging
- storage
- kerberos authentication
- bootloader
- [tuned (power management)](https://galaxy.ansible.com/linux-system-roles/tuned/)

## Contributing

Each subsystem is separated into individual repositories within the
[linux-system-roles](https://github.com/linux-system-roles) GitHub project.
Just open a new issue against the appropriate subsystem's issue tracker to
report bugs or request enhancements.  New subsystem requests or feedback can be
provided to the project's landing page at
[linux-system-roles.github.io](https://linux-system-roles.github.io) Pull
requests welcome!

## Sounds great! How do I try it out?

First, install Ansible on the system that you intend to use as your "control
node".  See the [Ansible Installation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html#installation)
docs for instructions.

Next, pull these roles from Ansible Galaxy.

```
# ansible-galaxy install linux-system-roles.email
# ansible-galaxy install linux-system-roles.kdump
# ansible-galaxy install linux-system-roles.network
# ansible-galaxy install linux-system-roles.selinux
# ansible-galaxy install linux-system-roles.timesync
```

Here is an example playbook file we have named <em>example-network.yml</em> to
test out the network role.

```yaml
---
- hosts: TEST.local
  become: yes
  become_method: sudo
  become_user: root
  vars:
    network_connections:
      - name: DBnic
        state: up
        type: ethernet
        interface_name: eth1
        autoconnect: yes
        ip:
          dhcp4: yes
          auto6: no
  roles:
    - role: rhel-system-roles.network
```

Execute the playbook against your test machine, called TEST.local for this
example.

```
# ansible-playbook -l TEST.local example-network.yml
```
